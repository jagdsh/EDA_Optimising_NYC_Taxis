# EDA_Optimising_NYC_Taxis - Jagdsh Chand

## Objective
In this case study you will be learning exploratory data analysis (EDA) with the help of a dataset on yellow taxi rides in New York City. This will enable you to understand why EDA is an important step in the process of data science and machine learning.

## **Problem Statement**
As an analyst at an upcoming taxi operation in NYC, you are tasked to use the 2023 taxi trip data to uncover insights that could help optimise taxi operations. The goal is to analyse patterns in the data that can inform strategic decisions to improve service efficiency, maximise revenue, and enhance passenger experience.


## Tasks
You need to perform the following steps for successfully completing this assignment:
1. Data Loading
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Analysis: Bivariate and Multivariate
4. Creating Visualisations to Support the Analysis
5. Deriving Insights and Stating Conclusions


## Data Understanding
The yellow taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.

The data is stored in Parquet format (*.parquet*). The dataset is from 2009 to 2024. However, for this assignment, we will only be using the data from 2023.

The data for each month is present in a different parquet file. You will get twelve files for each of the months in 2023.

The data was collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers like vendors and taxi hailing apps. <br>

**Trip Records**



|Field Name       |description |
|:----------------|:-----------|
| VendorID | A code indicating the TPEP provider that provided the record. <br> 1= Creative Mobile Technologies, LLC; <br> 2= VeriFone Inc. |
| tpep_pickup_datetime | The date and time when the meter was engaged.  |
| tpep_dropoff_datetime | The date and time when the meter was disengaged.   |
| Passenger_count | The number of passengers in the vehicle. <br> This is a driver-entered value. |
| Trip_distance | The elapsed trip distance in miles reported by the taximeter. |
| PULocationID | TLC Taxi Zone in which the taximeter was engaged |
| DOLocationID | TLC Taxi Zone in which the taximeter was disengaged |
|RateCodeID |The final rate code in effect at the end of the trip.<br> 1 = Standard rate <br> 2 = JFK <br> 3 = Newark <br>4 = Nassau or Westchester <br>5 = Negotiated fare <br>6 = Group ride |
|Store_and_fwd_flag |This flag indicates whether the trip record was held in vehicle memory before sending to the vendor, aka “store and forward,” because the vehicle did not have a connection to the server.  <br>Y= store and forward trip <br>N= not a store and forward trip |
|Payment_type| A numeric code signifying how the passenger paid for the trip. <br> 1 = Credit card <br>2 = Cash <br>3 = No charge <br>4 = Dispute <br>5 = Unknown <br>6 = Voided trip |
|Fare_amount| The time-and-distance fare calculated by the meter. <br>Extra Miscellaneous extras and surcharges.  Currently, this only includes the 0.50 and 1 USD rush hour and overnight charges. |
|MTA_tax |0.50 USD MTA tax that is automatically triggered based on the metered rate in use. |
|Improvement_surcharge | 0.30 USD improvement surcharge assessed trips at the flag drop. The improvement surcharge began being levied in 2015. |
|Tip_amount |Tip amount – This field is automatically populated for credit card tips. Cash tips are not included. |
| Tolls_amount | Total amount of all tolls paid in trip.  |
| total_amount | The total amount charged to passengers. Does not include cash tips. |
|Congestion_Surcharge |Total amount collected in trip for NYS congestion surcharge. |
| Airport_fee | 1.25 USD for pick up only at LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy Airports|

Although the amounts of extra charges and taxes applied are specified in the data dictionary, you will see that some cases have different values of these charges in the actual data.

**Taxi Zones**

Each of the trip records contains a field corresponding to the location of the pickup or drop-off of the trip, populated by numbers ranging from 1-263.

These numbers correspond to taxi zones, which may be downloaded as a table or map/shapefile and matched to the trip records using a join.

This is covered in more detail in later sections.
